Smart Layout for Smarter Learning
The core of the app lies in its clean and distraction-free quiz box. Users are greeted with a question, four possible answers, and a visible countdown timer set to 30 seconds. The layout ensures that the content remains the focus.

Key UI Sections:
Timer (#time): Positioned at the top, keeping the user aware of the ticking clock.

Question Area (.question): Clearly displays the active question.

Answer Options: Each <li> holds a radio button and a label, styled for visibility and ease of selection.

Submit Button (#submmit): Allows the user to lock in their answer and proceed.
